
# 🧩 Flask Endpoint Stub Generator

This script automatically generates stub functions for missing Flask endpoints in the `views.py` file. It's useful for scaffolding backend logic in larger systems where you need to ensure that all required views are present.

---

## 📁 Structure

- **`/app/views.py`** – the file that is checked and updated.
- **`MISSING_ENDPOINTS`** – a list of endpoint names that are missing.
- **Functions:**
  - `endpoint_to_route_and_func()` – converts an endpoint name into a URL route, function name, and HTTP methods.
  - `stub_code()` – generates Python code for a stub Flask view.
  - `main()` – the script’s main logic.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The script reads the `./app/views.py` file.
2. For each endpoint in `MISSING_ENDPOINTS`, it checks whether a corresponding function already exists.
3. If the function does **not** exist – it adds a stub Flask view returning **501 Not Implemented**.
4. The updated file is saved back to disk.

## 🖥️ Example of Generated Code

```python
@views_bp.route('/assets/<int:id>/edit', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def asset_edit():
    return 'Not implemented', 501
````

## ▶️ Usage

Make sure you're in the project’s root directory (where the script is located), then run:

```bash
python generate_stub_endpoints.py
```

> The script will modify the file `./app/views.py`.

## ⚠️ Notes

* The script does **not** check for route duplication – only for duplicate function names.
* Intended for Flask projects using a `Blueprint` named `views_bp`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Flask project structure
* Write permissions for `./app/views.py`
